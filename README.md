# Excel Macro Dashboard (First Attempt)

This was my very first project where I explored how to create an interactive Excel dashboard using Macros (VBA).  
At the time, I had just started learning Excel and was curious about automating tasks.  
While it's not perfect, it holds a special place in my journey — it was my first step toward automation.

## 📝 Note

> This was my **first attempt** at using Macros. It’s not perfect, but I’m proud of starting somewhere.  
> I’ve come a long way since then — and today I actively work with:
> - 📊 Power BI (Dashboards, DAX, Power Query)
> - 🧮 SQL (Data querying & transformations)
> - 🐍 Python (for automation & data analysis)

I still value this project because it reminds me how far I’ve come. 🙌
